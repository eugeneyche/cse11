    What is a procedural language

    What is an object, class, instance

Short History of Programming
    1943: The ENIAC at UPenn
        Used to calculate Artillery Projectile Calculations 19,000 Vacuum Tube
        Programmed in Assembly i.e. Machine Code
    Assembly
        Comtrols the movement of bits
        i.e.
            pushl %edp
            movl %esp, ebp
            subl $4, %esp
            movl $10, -4(%ebp)
            leal -4(%ebp), %eax
            addl %66, (%eax)
            leave
            ret
        Not readable without comments
        Specific to brand particular hardware
        Prone to errors. Slow to program. Essentially not used today
    1955:FORTRAN (Formula Translation) Higher level compiled to lower level
    1958:LISP (List Processing)
    1959:COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language
    1964:BASIC (Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
        These were critical to programmability of computers
            English-like constructions
            Compilers changed that to lower level computer language
    1970:PASCAL
        UCSD made Pascal Protable
    1972:C
        This made the UNIX operating system practical
        Most of Linux kernel is in C
    1978:SQL
        Program databases
    1980:C++
        C with clases
    1991:Python
    1995:Java
        Rapid Applications Development
        Object Oriented
        Loosely based on C
