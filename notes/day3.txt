Difference between Java Applications and Java Applets
    Applet
        Designed to run in web browser
        Have  no access to local file systems (security issue)
    To run...
        Use appletviewer
        Convert to a java application
Different Parts of Hello 2
    import - allows use of classes written elsewhere
    class - a type definition. An object template.
        - Instance variables, constructors, methods
    extends - builds upon an already defined class
    Methods - sequences of statements to do something (code)
        - OnMousePress(), onMouseRelease(), ...
        - Event handling routines respond to specific input (on applet or application)
    canvas -grpahical sketch paper
    ; - ends a java statement
    new Text ("Hello, World", 40, 50, canvas);
        new creates a new instance of a class (Text, in this case)
Java Names
    Valid identifiers
    Series of letters, number, underscores, $
    An identifer cannot start with a number
    An identifer cannot have other special characters
    $ is valid, but in general, we do not use it because it is reserved for automatically generate java code.
    Class/Interface - Upper Camel Case
    Method - Lower Camel Case
    Instance and class variables - Lower Camel Case
    Local variables/parameters. Lower case letters, short words.
    Constants - All caps with underscores
Comments
    Comments are essential. They describe in English what a class is supposed to do or how a particular algorithm works
What is an instance
    It is a particular object that has been properly initized from a class template.
