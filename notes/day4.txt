What is an instance?
    It is a particular object that has been properly initialized from a class template.
Instance Variables
    State variables
    Can be public or private
        public means the variable is visible outside of the class
        private means the variable is only visible within the class
    Good programming style is to have accessor methods to get a copy of an instance's private variable
Parameters and Formal Parameter
    Formal parameter is the place holder for the value of the actual parameter.
How a parameters sent to Methods
    Primitive types:
        Integer, double, boolean are sent by value i.e. they are copied into the parameter
    All others - send by reference
        The address of the object is passed and copied over, and therefore the actual object itself is passed.
Working are two number types in Java
    Int - Integers (-1, 0, 10, 1024)
    Double - floating point numbers (-1.0, 0.0, 10.0, 1024.0, ...)
    They cannot be used interchange-ably
        You can convert an int to a double
        You can explicitly force a conversion of a double to an int
